# Given two integers, num and t. A number is achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation:
#
# Increase or decrease the number by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.
# Return the maximum achievable number after applying the operation at most t times.
#


class Solution:
    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:
        return num + 2 * t
